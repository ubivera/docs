# Ubivera Contributor Agreement (Passion Project Phase)

## 1. Introduction and Purpose

This Contributor Agreement ("Agreement") is entered into by and between:

* **Joseph Tindall**, the sole creator and owner of the project initiative known as **Ubivera** (Joseph Tindall in this capacity is hereinafter referred to as the "Project Owner," and the project itself as "Ubivera" or the "Project"); and
* **Jack Heggie** (hereinafter referred to as "Contributor" or "You").

The purpose of this Agreement is to clarify the terms under which You, as a Contributor, will provide Contributions (as defined below) to Ubivera. Ubivera is currently a pre-commercial, passion-driven software project, solely created, owned, and initiated by the Project Owner, aimed at developing a set of microservices and potentially a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) offering. This Agreement outlines intellectual property ownership of Contributions, current compensation expectations, and potential future considerations.

By making a Contribution to Ubivera, You acknowledge that You have read, understood, and agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement.

## 2. Nature of Project and Collaboration

Both parties acknowledge that:
* Ubivera is currently a **passion project** with no existing revenue or commercial operations.
* Contributions made by You are voluntary and made with the understanding of the project's current non-commercial status.
* The collaboration may involve activities such as pair programming, discussions of ideas, and development of software components for Ubivera.

## 3. Definition of "Contribution"

"Contribution" shall mean any and all code, software, algorithms, designs, ideas, concepts, documentation, suggestions, improvements, bug fixes, features, graphics, or any other works of authorship or information that You conceive, develop, create, or submit, whether orally or in writing, to the Project Owner for Ubivera or for incorporation into any of Ubivera's projects or repositories.

**This explicitly includes, but is not limited to, all repositories currently existing or created in the future within the GitHub organization located at https://github.com/ubivera.**

## 4. Intellectual Property Rights

**4.1. Assignment of Contributions:** You hereby irrevocably assign to the **Project Owner**, for the benefit of Ubivera, all right, title, and interest worldwide in and to all Contributions You make, including all copyrights, patent rights, trade secret rights, and any other intellectual property rights therein. This assignment is for the full term of such rights and includes any extensions or renewals. To the extent that moral rights cannot be assigned, You waive such moral rights to the fullest extent permissible under applicable law.

**4.2. Ownership by Project Owner:** You agree that all Contributions will be the sole and exclusive property of the Project Owner (for Ubivera). The Project Owner shall have the exclusive right to use, reproduce, modify, distribute, sublicense, display, perform, and create derivative works from the Contributions for any purpose, commercial or otherwise, without any further obligation or compensation to You, except as may be separately agreed in writing pursuant to Section 6.

**4.3. Further Assurances:** You agree to execute any further documents and take any further actions reasonably requested by the Project Owner, at no cost to the Contributor, to perfect, register, or enforce the Project Owner's rights in the Contributions for Ubivera.

## 5. No Current Compensation or Equity

You acknowledge and agree that:
* Your Contributions are made voluntarily and without any expectation of monetary compensation, salary, benefits, or any form of equity or ownership stake in Ubivera or from the Project Owner at the present time.
* This is a collaborative effort on a passion project, and any involvement is based on mutual interest in the project's development and potential.

## 6. Potential Future Renegotiation

Notwithstanding Section 5:
* Both the **Project Owner (Joseph Tindall, and/or Ubivera as a future formally constituted legal entity if applicable)** and **You (Jack Heggie)** acknowledge the aspiration for Ubivera to become a commercially viable and profitable entity.
* Should the Project Owner determine, or should Ubivera (if formally constituted as a legal entity) determine, that it has achieved a state of consistent profitability or secures significant investment leading to formal commercial operations, both parties agree to enter into good faith discussions to renegotiate Your involvement.
* These discussions may consider, without guarantee of any specific outcome, potential future compensation, an equity stake, profit-sharing, or other formal roles or agreements for You, based on factors such as the extent and impact of Your Contributions, market conditions, the company's financial status, and mutual agreement.
* This Section 6 constitutes an agreement to discuss and negotiate in good faith and does not imply any guaranteed future compensation or equity. Any future arrangement will require a separate written agreement signed by both parties.
* Either party may initiate these discussions if they believe the conditions mentioned above (profitability/investment) have been met.
* Examples of such conditions may include the generation of \$1,000 monthly revenue, \$20,000 in annual recurring revenue, or the acceptance of outside investment exceeding \$100,000.

## 7. Your Representations and Warranties

You represent and warrant that:
* You have the full right and authority to enter into this Agreement and to assign the rights to Your Contributions as set forth herein.
* Each of Your Contributions is Your original work and does not, to the best of Your knowledge, infringe upon or violate any patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, or other intellectual property right of any third party.
* If Your Contribution includes any third-party material, You have obtained all necessary permissions and licenses for the Project Owner (for Ubivera) to use such material under the terms of this Agreement.
* You have not entered into any agreement that would conflict with Your obligations under this Agreement.

## 8. No Obligation to Use Contributions

You understand and agree that the Project Owner (for Ubivera) is under no obligation to use, incorporate, or continue to use any Contribution You provide. The decision to use any Contribution is at the sole discretion of the Project Owner.

## 9. At-Will Contribution; No Employment

* Your decision to contribute is voluntary and at-will. You may cease making Contributions at any time.
* The Project Owner may, at his discretion, cease accepting Contributions from You for Ubivera at any time.
* This Agreement does not create an employment, partnership, agency, or joint venture relationship between You and the **Project Owner** or **Ubivera (as the Project)**. You are an independent contributor.
